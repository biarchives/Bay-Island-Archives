        <h1>About Bay Islands Archives</h1>
        <p>
          Bay Islands Archives is a digital repository built to preserve and celebrate the voices, stories, and
          histories
          of the Bay Islands.
          This project was created to honor the deep cultural heritage of the islands by collecting and sharing images,
          videos, documents, and oral histories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to capture the visual legacy of our communities and make it accessible to both those still living
          in
          the Bay Islands and those who have moved away.
          Whether you're researching family history, exploring your roots, or simply seeking a deeper connection to home
          â€”
          this space is for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This archive is maintained with love and respect for the people of the Bay Islands. We believe that every
          story
          matters, and we invite you to explore, remember, and share.
